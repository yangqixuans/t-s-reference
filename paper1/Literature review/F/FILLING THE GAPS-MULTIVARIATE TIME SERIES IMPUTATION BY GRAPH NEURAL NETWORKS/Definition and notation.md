+ time-series analysis
#spatial-similarity 
+ does not necessarily mean physical proximity, but rather indicates that considered sensors are related a generic functional depedency and/or that are close in a certain latent space.   
+ Relational information, then can be interpreted as a set of constraints - linking the different time series - that allows replacing the malfunctioning sensors with virtual ones.
#MTSI
+ multivariate time series imputaion
