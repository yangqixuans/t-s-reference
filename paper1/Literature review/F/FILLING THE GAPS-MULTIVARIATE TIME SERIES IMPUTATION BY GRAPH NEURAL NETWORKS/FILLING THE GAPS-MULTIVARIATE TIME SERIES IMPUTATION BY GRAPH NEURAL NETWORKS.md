## Abstract
1. standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies.
2. most imputation methods based on deeplearning do not explicitly model relational aspects.
3. graph neural networks:processing sequential data with relational; inductive biases
4. GRIN:reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivarite time series by learning spatio-temporal reperesentations through message passing
